    Hello
  
    <div id="editor" style="width:400px; height: 100px;">
        <input class="card-content form-control" value="<p><a href=&quot;http://Wikirate.org&quot;>Wikirate.org</a> is just getting started and still has lots of rough edges.

On Wikirate users can create fully transparent company ratings based on real data underlying metrics which the community deem important. To help facilitate this, Wikirate invites all public ratings to be hosted on the site free of charge, allowing users to compare and contrast ratings and build a clear picture of what companies are doing. You can see more about what's coming in the [[Introducing Ratings]] section.</p></li></ul><h1>User Account</h1><ul><li><p><strong>What are the benefits of creating a Wikirate account?</strong><br>Signing up for a Wikirate account allows you to contribute to the site by writing overviews, adding notes and sources, and editing pretty much any information on the website.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Who can sign up for an Account?</strong><br>Anyone can [[/new/SignUp|sign up]] for an account.

Once you arrive on the &quot;New Note&quot; form, insert the URL of the source you would like to make a Note about and phrase your Note with less than 100 characters. Then you can tag your Note with a Company and Topic. To enter additional information, such as supporting your Note with a basis, click on &quot;Add basis&quot; below the Note field.

Don't forget to click &quot;Add&quot; afterwards.<br><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Can I base my Note on Sources added by others?</strong><br>Yes, absolutely. Every Source has a &quot;Make a Note&quot; button that allows you to make a Note based on it, regardless of who added the Source. You can browse all Sources on Wikirate [[Source|here]]. Tip: Look out for upvoted Sources when making Notes, as high voting scores indicate soure credibility.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Can I edit a Note after submission and how?</strong><br>Yes, you can edit your own Notes after submission. If you want to edit Notes of other users, please follow the [[Editing Principles]].<br>To edit a Note, mouse over the editing icon ({{editimage|core;size:icon}}) and click on &quot;Edit&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;Name&quot;.<br><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Why do Notes have a character limit?</strong><br>The purpose of limiting Notes to 100 characters is to make them easily shareable through social media channels in the future.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Where can I see the Notes I have added?</strong><br>To see an overview of your contributions on the Wikirate platform, simply access your personal Wikirate profile by clicking on your account name in the top right corner of the homepage.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Who can see the Notes I add?</strong><br>Notes and other content added on <a href=&quot;http://Wikirate.org&quot;>Wikirate.org</a> can be accessed by anyone visiting the web page. However, only registered members can modify existing content.</p></li></ul><h1>Sources</h1><ul><li><p><strong>What can be a source on Wikirate?</strong><br>Any publicly available online content can be added as a source on Wikirate (for example news overviews, videos, presentation etc). Currently it is not possible to source documents that have not yet been published on the web.</p></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>How do I add Sources?</strong><br>To add a Source, click on &quot;+Add&quot; in the top menu and click on &quot;Source&quot;. Once you arrive on the &quot;New Page&quot; form, insert the URL of the webpage you would like to add as a source and just wait a few seconds for the system to automatically fill the main fields such as “Title” and “Description”. Then you can tag your Source with a Company and Topic. You can also edit any information automatically filled should it be incorrect. You should also add the date the source was published since this will allow the source to be used in the future in timelines and other visualizations. You can also tag your Source with keywords such as the country/region the source refers to, the advocacy organization linked to the events and so on. You shouldn't forget to click “Submit” to be sure all data will be saved on Wikirate.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Can a PDF file be added as a source?</strong><br>Currently PDF documents can be added as sources, if they have already been published on a public web page.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Should sources always be in English?</strong><br>You are more than welcome to add sources in languages other than English. However, we recommend you to add some background information about the source in the 'Description' field (in English) to allow other users to further use the source in notes and overviews.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Does adding a source mean I agree with it?</strong><br>You should only add sources you consider reliable and credible, but you are free to add any content as a source, even when you do not agree with it.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Based on what should I up/downvote a source? </strong><br>Not everything out there on the internet is trustworthy, so Wikirate has a voting system to assess Sources' credibility. In assessing the credibility of a Source you might want to consider who has produced it and whether they have a good or bad track record of reliable, unbiased reporting – you should also consider the strength of the evidence which the Source presents. <br> You can vote on notes and sources by clicking the voting buttons beside them. Upvotes increase the score for that item by one point - use these for Notes you think are important and Sources that are credible. Downvotes decrease the source's score by one point and should be used for poor quality Sources.</p></li></ul><h1>Overviews</h1><ul><li><p><strong>What is an Overview?</strong><br>An overview is a summary of available information about the behaviour of a Company in relation to a Topic.<br>Overviews should always cite Notes, which in turn cite Sources. Overview pages display not only the overview itself but also lists of Notes related to the Overview's Company and Topic.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>How can I edit existing Overviews?</strong><br>To edit existing overviews, after logging in with your username and password, hover over the editing icon (edit icon|core}} ) in the top right hand corner of the overview page and select ‘Edit’, then ‘Content’.<br>You have now the possibility to add/delete part of the text and to include further information by citing new notes. (See how do I cite a note within an overview below).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>How do I cite a note within an overview?</strong><br>To cite a note simply click on the ‘Cite!’ button next to it. This will open a yellow window on top of the overview text box with the citing syntax. Copy/paste the syntax into the overview where you want the citation to be included and click submit to save the change.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>How can I see what contributions and changes have been made to a specific overview?</strong><br>To visualise contributions and changes made to an overview simply hover over the ( ) icon on the top right corner of the overview box and select “View”, then “History”. Now you can see all the previous versions of the overview. Additions to the overview are shown in green, whereas removed information is shown in red. To access full details of the previous version simply click on the play button on the right hand side. Please be aware, that by selecting “Save as Current” in any of the previous versions you are viewing, all subsequent changes will be removed.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Is it possible to undo changes made to an overview?</strong><br>To undo changes made to an overview you should hover over the editing icon and select “View”, then “History”. You can now access previous versions of the overview and you can simply save any of them as current to undo unwanted changes.</p></li></ul><h1>Feedback and Bug Reporting<br></h1><ul><li><p><strong>How can I share feedback or report bugs on the website?</strong><br>There are currently 2 ways of communicating with the Wikirate tech team:<br>1) Start a new [[discussion]] <br>2) Send an email to <a href=&quot;mailto:info@wikirate.org&quot;>info@wikirate.org</a><br></p></li></ul><h1>Partnership</h1><ul><li><p><strong>I am considering using Wikirate's tools to disseminate my organisation's research.
